An implementation of the Goldberg-Tarjan push/relabel maximum flow algorithm.

Originally presented in:

Andrew V. Goldberg and Robert E. Tarjan. “A New Approach to the Maximum-Flow
Problem”. In: Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery 35.4 (1988),
pp. 921–940. doi: 10.1145/48014.61051.

maxflow.py - contains the algorithm
maxflow_application.py - contains the driver program. 

It takes an argument that is a text file as input. Several example input files are included

To run:
```
python3.10 -m maxflow_application.py input.txt

python -m maxflow_application.py input.txt
